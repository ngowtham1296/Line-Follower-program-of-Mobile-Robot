# **PROJECT TITLE: MOBILE ROBOT MOTION CONTROL**This project mainly focuses on the motion control of a Mobile robot (Alpha Bot). In this attempt we used a PID controller to make the robot to follow its path. To make this happen the robot is equipped with Raspberry pi microcontroller, Ultraviolet, IR sensors. The Raspberry Pi is connected with the Linux system via Ethernet. We can activate the code remotely from our desktop using Raspberry pi Linux terminal.### **Getting Started:**1. **Prerequisites:** - ALPHA BOT- MOBILE ROBOT - Raspberry pi programming - Feedback Control system - PID control algorithm1. **Installation:** - Assemble the Mobile bot as per the instructions given in         **Link:** [https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/c/c7/AlphaBot-User-Manual.pdf](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/c/c7/AlphaBot-User-Manual.pdf) - Connect the raspberry pi board to the PC to activate the remote Linux desktop          **Link:** [https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/how-to-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-laptop-display](https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/how-to-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-laptop-display)1. **Run:** - Make a circuit with a black tape of thickness not less than 1 inch for the robot to travel. - After the setup of the mobile robot and the circuit, run the main\_code.py in the terminal window of Linux remote desktop. - After clicking the run option, make the robots IR sensor to face the black tape for at least 5 seconds to calibrate the sensors. - After this place the robot on the track of black tap. The bot tracks the its path and uses PID algorithm to take left/right turn, navigates itself and stops after 50 inch distance of travel. - These parameters like P,I,D and the stopping distance can be adjusted in the main\_code.py.
